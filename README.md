# MetaGXplore: Cancer Patient Metastasis Identification with Deep Learning and Multi-omics
### Major version 0.1.1
## Overview 
MetaGXplore (Integrating Multi-Omics Data with Graph convolutional networks for Pan-cancer Patient METAstasis Identification) is a novel deep learning model that represents the first attempt to integrate Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) with multi-omics pan-cancer data for predicting metastasis.

### Objective
The goal of MetaGXplore is to assist professionals in making treatment decisions by predicting the risk of metastasis for a specific patient. Additionally, to enhance the interpretability of MetaGXplore, we employed the Graph Mask and Feature Mask methods from GNNExplainer.

### Use and distribution
In general, we recommend testing and using MetaGXplore with patient multi-omics data.

### Installation
You can install MetaGXplore via pip:
  
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/TJiangBio/MetaGXplore.git
 ```
  
  ```
  pip install python=3.9.0 torch=1.12.0 torch_geometric=2.5.2 numpy=1.24.3 pandas =2.2.2
```
